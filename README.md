<h2>Venice-Boat-Classification</h2>
This is the classification problem where the task is to classify boats among certain category. The boat can be classify in certain category. 
<h2> Project Overview </h2>
In this work, I have used three appraoches:
 <ol>
  <li> In first approach, I made a neural network from scratch.</li>
  <li> In second approach, I used transfer learning where features of pretrained network in this case i use VGG16 except last predicting layer, and those features for featrures for Support vector Classifier. </li>

  </ol>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Keras</li>
  <li>Python== 2.7.5 </li>
</ul>

<h2>Important Note.</h2>
Very basic classification task but its a great start for developing deeper knowledge in deep learning.
