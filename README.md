<h2>Venice-Boat-Classification</h2>

Using Keras to do Image classifaction of boats as well as
using concept of transfer learning to only
extract the feature of the image and apply svm on top of it 

# two approach that i used?
  1 Create my own architecture for image classification and use keras for do it 
  2 Used Transfer learning concept and extract the feature of the each image use each image as a row in the data set and use 
    SVM on top of it , but the accuracy is horrable because i didn't select the feature that are appropriate to do the classification as well as i build simple MLP(multi layer perceptron with) input as first layer and output as the number of classes . We can increase the accuracy we have to work on the selection of the feature and remove most of the feature.
